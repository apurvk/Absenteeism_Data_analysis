# Absenteeism_Data_analysis
My analysis on the absenteeeism dataset. Do check it out, and I am open to discussions and views. 

According to the Oxford Dictionary, Absenteeism refers to the “act of staying away from the place of work without any good reason”. The issue of absenteeism is a critical problem for any organisation. For an organisation, big or small, it is essentially the people or the manpower that runs the company, they are the driving force of the company. Every employee working together as part of a bigger organisation, like cogs of a machine.
Every case of absenteeism leads to some loss for the company, because an employee absent for a day leads to some capital going to waste for that day.
Therefore if a company has a high case of absenteeism, it needs to acquire the reason for the same, so that it could change its policies or rules to better accumulate its employees, and ultimately bring down the rate of absenteeism. 

In this project, we try to look at the features or reasons which lead to an organisation having an issue of absenteeism, and try to give solutions to the problems.
